"1"	"Some commenters are getting hung up on him quitting boot camp and not 
paying attention to what he's trying to say. Fact is, the military isn't 
used to fight for freedom and many, not all, but many people who join the 
military are just insecure and looking for validation. News flash: joining 
the military doesn't make your dick bigger.

I don't know what's worse, being insecure or being a complete dumbass. 
Either way, joining the military in its current form is a bad idea, unless 
you actually enjoy being told what to do and serving corporate interests 
for which you'll see little, if any, benefit.﻿"
"2"	"He's right.﻿"
"3"	"you may want to do some fact checking.... use Google it'll help﻿"
"4"	"As an army veteran I don't blame him for quitting, the rest of you can be 
brown nosers all you want but he speaks the truth. As the old saying goes, 
the truth hurts. The only reason you're putting him down and reacting is 
because HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH. Millner keep posting videos fuck what they 
say, they are scared and fear has a tendency to cause the fearful to lash 
out especially when they're in denial not the river either. I know all too 
well how brainwashing the military is, they would but unfortunately fear 
rules their lives instead of INTEGRITY. fwm you brainwashed pussies﻿"
"5"	"hey buddy in basic you are all scum. you are nothing until you complete 
basic.you are all one. they break you down to build you up. basic is hard 
but it is worth it to know that you sculpted to be the best you can be. you 
tapped out because you did not have the will power to do so. secondly you 
have no room to talk YOU didnt get the the eagle globe and anchor.you serve 
to protect and defend the great nation of the united states of america and 
free all men women and children that are oppressed by the greedy and 
corrupt, war is war. if you poke the sleeping bear you get mauled. you did 
not even serve in a tour. no room what so ever. and you having a shitty 
childhood should have been a push for you to be greater and better then 
ware you came from. if you stuck through it you would a had one of the 
biggest familys on the planet. every soldier is a brother in arms. till 
death. you fight for them and you fight for the vary freedom people neglect 
to know how good they have it. that is the gist of my rant. nuff said.﻿"
"6"	"Pussyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy﻿"
"7"	"Let me see ur Deployment bracelet﻿"
"8"	"you didn't finish Boot Camp. The Fuck, the Military idls not like that. 
it's not the 80's.﻿"
"9"	"idk why you join the military especially USMC if youre a pussy, and atleast 
educate yourself before you sign yourself to the military thats not their 
fault﻿"
"10"	"He is saying some truth to what's going on around us but that is still not 
the real reason he quit during boot camp he just couldn't hack it sounds 
like he's going to start crying in this video if he knew all this he would 
of never joined the marine corps and he sure didn't learn this in boot camp 
stop fronting you just couldn't hack it! Pussy!﻿"
"11"	"Hey man, forget all these butthurt military men in the comments, I respect 
you for speaking the truth. The military is a program made to turn innocent 
civillians into killers who can pull a trigger and end a life without a 
thought. Never let anyone tell you you're wrong for speaking the truth and 
voicing your opinion﻿"
"12"	"your a pussy bro﻿"
"13"	"I loved your video, I loved the way you shared your 20 year experience of 
knowledge, but you still talk like a monkey, and use ebonics as your 
primary language.Niggers like you belong in prison and not in a time 
honored group such as the US military.Yes, you are a pussy, and my two year 
old sister could kick your ass.If you don't like America enough to fight 
for it, move back to your nigger country of Afrika. I misspelled Afrika so 
that you would be able to read it.DUMB NICKER﻿"
"14"	"its called WAR for a fucking reason. this an example of a weak minded 
person .﻿"
"15"	"true.. just kill evwn innocents...﻿"
"16"	"this man talking reckless I'm joining the marines in three years to fight 
for my country man grow some nuts n stop talking reckless﻿"
"17"	"dumb asf﻿"
"18"	"Hey buddy FUCK. YOU.﻿"
"19"	"He probably didn't even join﻿"
"20"	"Why all the disslikes ? He is spot on!﻿"
"21"	"You are spot on about america. Well done on telling the truth ! And getting 
yourself out of the army. The worst part about it is the normal man on the 
street is still verry asleep 80% of this stupid fucking world just don't 
know what's going on and don't seem to care.﻿"
"22"	"Don't listen to these brainwashed guys hating on you bro, war is murder. 
These people don't understand, feel pity for their illiterate asses.﻿"
"23"	"lol you are a pansy﻿"
"24"	"I love your video, thanks for the courage you exercise﻿"
"25"	"it's funny only the people that get kicked out have something bad to say 
about the military. it would be interesting to hear what you are doing with 
your life now. Even better what are you doing to change anything that you 
are complaining about. Otherwise you are just another disgruntled person 
bumping gums and paying lip service﻿"
"26"	"You quit because you're undisciplined and weak﻿"
"27"	"Don't you go to prison if you're enlisted go to boot camp and go awol?﻿"
"28"	"The us military isn't controlled by the UN, dumbass﻿"
"29"	"Bro this nigga is high asf lmao﻿"
"30"	"yooo hes actually right !!!﻿"
"31"	"This kid is high as fuck﻿"
"32"	"A failure has to victimise them self and talk shit about the thing he 
wasn't good enough to become. 
he's a boot-camp drop-out so now he has to de-legitimise the Marines. 
i feel sorry for him - even though he's a dumfuck﻿"
"33"	"Dumbest shit ever. I am currently in the process of getting a tattoo that's 
located on the back of my neck removed so I can join the army. If you 
couldn't do it just admit it! You can't tell people not to join with these 
reasons. They do all of this for you to be prepared when you're in deep 
shit so then you have the knowledge to get out of the situation or fight 
back! My cousin and friend are leaving for Afghanistan in June and I have 
other friends who have also served in Iraq! Don't you dare say anything 
about deployments if you haven't been through one!﻿"
"34"	"You sniff alot. Plus once you started talking about united Nations, I 
dismissed you. Good Luck﻿"
"35"	"UN doesn't control our military?﻿"
"36"	"who's this puss?﻿"
"37"	"this mother fuckn monkey needs some banana to suck on,pssh fuckn pussy 
don't have the guts to continue,but them females steps right up to every 
chanellge n hold their ground holding it down like a boss,what a fuckn 
shamed so shut da fuck up dawg.﻿"
"38"	"the man speaks truth they have no mercy﻿"
"39"	"Someone who didn't make it past bootcamp should NOT talk about the military 
like he knows shit. You don't. Shut the fuck up.﻿"
"40"	"Theres a difference between being a Racist, and just breaking you down. 
Thats what BMT is for, to break you down and then mold you into a soldier. 
Im not arguing that they don't \"brain wash\" because in a sense they do, but 
when you sign up for the military, you're signing your life away to that 
branch of service. It really isn't for everyone, because like you said \"in 
order to kill you have to think less of the person your killing\" But thats 
not the case for everyone. You may think of everyone else as equal, but 
your friend may see someone as a murderer. Now back to the whole racism 
thing, they can get a bit harsh, id imagine so (I havent gone to Marine 
Basic Training) But again its to basically make you realize that you are at 
the bottom of the food chain, because at that point you really are at the 
bottom of the food chain. I mean thats how I look at things. But I dont 
think you should be saying \"Don't join the military\" you're making it sound 
worse than what it actually is.﻿"
"41"	"brave soldiers defending our land..... fickle americans. yes they are 
brave, or stupid, choosing on how you look at it. but defending youre land, 
the last war on u.s. soil, i believe was civil, and then you were going at 
each other.﻿"
"42"	"Lmao pussy hahahahahaha who cares where you're from and what fucked up 
family you have. What matters is how you improve yourself. Keep complaining 
and pointing fingers for your mishaps. Dumb ass﻿"
"43"	"What he is saying is the truth. Your joining a organization that doesn't 
care about you. It's crazy how people are so gun ho even to the very end. 
My buddy had been on tour and now is a double amputee and has been fighting 
with the VA for years and still not a cent.﻿"
"44"	"when you join the military your all one color nowon wants to hear someones 
sht about it being racist its the least racist job ive ever been in people 
should be able to get out so we only have the men an women willing to go 
through the pain realizing when you get there its not for you is one thing 
but dont claim racism just cause your black and if someone is gonna talk 
about the fuckd up sht the gov does why you gonna join in the first place 
to get there and quit i dont wanna go down range with someone like this 
anyway and ive seen em an heard em before i wish theyd all get out with 
there bullsht﻿"
"45"	"You know what's funny in the Army and Marines when you quit during basic 
they don't just let you up and leave. So he had to stay there with recruits 
making fun of his ass for quitting, fucking with him for about 4 weeks. And 
then made a YouTube video about it and other buckshot, for excuses.﻿"
"46"	"join the military for money? GTFO of here with that BULLSHIT. Have you seen 
the paychecks for junior enlisted. LOL﻿"
"47"	"I don't blame him one bit for getting out, he made a wise choice. I took my 
\"Asvab\" back in 2010 and I am happy that I never signed those papers and I 
know quite a bit of people who got out as quick as they could also. 
\"Hollywood\" makes everything seem better than what reality really is. Come 
on, we fund terrorist (United States). There's no honor fighting in wars 
you shouldn't be in and especially dying for a cause you thought was legit 
because you got programmed at such a young age.﻿"
"48"	"we should take a little bit of the money they use to fund the military and 
use it to fund NASA.﻿"
"49"	"My view on this is that if you want to serve your country and protect the 
innocent then do so and be dedicated and committed to doing so! Because you 
quit the military, that's your decision but don't go bad mouthing them 
cause you couldn't make it past Boot camp and the basic work outs and 
training that im positive your recruiter gave you the knowledge about 
before hand. And I wanna know how you can just up and quit without getting 
a dishonorable discharge or did you get kicked out? My father served in the 
Military for 14 years and fought for dumb people such as yourself, so NEXT 
TIME YOU WANNA ADDRESS HE MILITARY AS A WHOLE, MAKE IT PAST BOOT CAMP, GET 
DEPLOYED, SHOT A THE ENEMY, AND COME BACK HOME TO YOUR FAMILY, the fix your 
negative mouth to say that the military is a conspricay, mind washing, and 
what not﻿"
"50"	"why is he looking around all the time is he looking at his door because of 
2 men are coming to get him because he is late on paying off a loan 
shark?!?!?!﻿"
"51"	"Fricking pussey, dont listen to this horseshit!﻿"
"52"	"Scrub!!﻿"
"53"	"Your a literal dumb piece of shit. I literally wanna smack the shit out of 
you. Go fuck yourself﻿"
"54"	"Absolutely right﻿"
"55"	"All this shit he's asking people to research, he somehow realized it during 
BCT, all while having no access to a cell phone or a computer, or you know 
he bitched out.﻿"
"56"	"AMEN!......THANK YOU FOR TRUTH!﻿"
"57"	"Can I have that 6 minutes of my life back?﻿"
"58"	"I think at least the U.S government or whatever should at least have 
decency to treat their veterans right!! I see a shit load of homeless 
veterans allover the STREETS !! come on they risk their lives in damn Iraq 
, Afghanistan etc even as far as World War 2 ..sucks﻿"
"59"	"when I was in the Marine Corps , we had a name for people like you ,..... 
they were called non hackers ,.....﻿"
"60"	"you are an un patriotic ass person..... i hope people like you don't make 
in life.... get out of this country you darn quitter﻿"
"61"	"and sorry if these people are hurting your feelings, you can still quit 
youtube too 😂😂😂﻿"
"62"	"I thought that you had some good reasons on why not to join because of some 
experiences on deployment, but he quit in the middle of bootcamp and never 
got deployed 😂. gtfo 😂you may not be a pussy, but you are really mentally 
weak, \"oh man they were mean to me, they made me feel like i wasn't a 
person\" 😂 get out here puss boy. now he is out here making excuses to why 
he quit 😂 lmao all that happened was that they separated the men from the 
boys.﻿"
"63"	"technically since you didn't make it past basic training you didn't quit 
the military because you were never really in the military.﻿"
"64"	"THATS WHY BEFORE YOU GO IN THE MILITARY ASK YOURSELF IF YOU COULD PULL THE 
TRIGGER..... IF WE were in another country we would be like oh ya thats why 
we are here﻿"
"65"	"Be safe, stay safe, don''f pay attention to negative remarks! Great advice 
to the young!﻿"
"66"	"marine corps is not racist. this is all an excuse. everyone bleeds the same 
color. just move on with your life and please quit embarrassing the corps.﻿"
"67"	"Glad I got a felony. What they gonna do when WW3 jump off. I don't know 
what this guy is talking about but the camel jockeys on some video game 
shit. This country has become weak and feminized. We go fuck up Iraq and 
get run out that bitch now you got a real WMD on our hands.We got the fuck 
up out of Vietnam. Russia armed them real good. Then I heard we spent many 
many millions of dollars to fight in Syria. The goal was to topple Assad 
like Hussein. Then what? When we see a Russian jet our fighter pilots are 
told to run away but they use it in better words to make it sound good but 
in reality Putin says fuck America. He could sense the cowardice of 
America. I give all the props to the American military. They are brave 
soldiers fighting and dying for meaningless causes. Facts are facts. Look 
how many died in Vietnam and Iraq war. We steady have rogue countries 
testing us. Such as N. Korea. Time to start dropping a few atom bombs. It 
sure saved millions of lives in Japan.💪💀🙈🌩🏁﻿"
"68"	"Fucking retard﻿"
"69"	"Hey man, I gotta give you props bro. You're not a pussy, you're SMART. 
Thank you for posting the video. Unfortunately, puppets aren't Smart.﻿"
"70"	"Stop and think about his life? You think he'll stop to think about yours?﻿"
"71"	"\"If you don't man go google that shit man\"

Strange, just about anyone could say the same to you. 

The constitution was suspended in 1865, there was no US it was called the 
Union? Followed by that? Pathetic.﻿"
"72"	"this is the truth bro.﻿"
"73"	"how old are you? dude.﻿"
"74"	"Week 2 is discipline week so you didnt even got to the Physical Tests﻿"
"75"	"thanks for speaking out! that's extremely bold of you and brave. Namaste my 
brother. stay real!﻿"
"76"	"They teach discipline. That's why they're strict, they aren't gonna go 
bunny soft.﻿"
"77"	"looks like hes reading something making this shit up and racism dude your 
were working your way to become a fucking marine who gives a flying fuck 
man up and live up to being a fucking Marine guys like you are just plain 
fucking stupid﻿"
"78"	"you can't quit the military lol. You got kicked the fuck out. Most likely 
because you couldn't handle it.﻿"
"79"	"I respect anyone who can admit they made a mistake. Fair play to you my 
brother to stand up and walk away from evil.﻿"
"80"	"Military and war are controlled by the bankers and the federal reserve. 
Every time the economy goes to crap, war is started by false pretenses. 
This guy is right. All the politics are are corrupt, dick Chaney was head 
of Halliburton which is a major war supplier. The US is a corporation ran 
and controlled by the elite. The military people are nothing but pawns to 
the money machine.﻿"
"81"	"This guy is just bitching that he couldn't finish basic training lol
what a loser﻿"
"82"	"This has to be a joke; honestly, what the fuck were you expecting when you 
signed up? Did you think the military was some sort of summer camp where 
all you do is prance around with American flags? Oh and by the way, you're 
thinking of NATO you thick bastard, not the fucking UN.﻿"
"83"	"Lol dude looks like he is about to cry making this video.. fucking PUSSY.﻿"
"84"	"All the people calling this guy a pussy, wouldn't say a word to his face.﻿"
"85"	"Nah nigga, you just a pussy XD﻿"
"86"	"Retarded pussy.﻿"
"87"	"This kid thinks \"the Constitution has been suspended since 1865\" and that 
\"the United Nations runs the military, not the US government\". The MC is 
better off with out you. Thanks for your service, but it seems that the 
service is better off.﻿"
"88"	"Oh shut up. \"I've never been a quitter\" you're just a little bitch who says 
he was in the \"military\" and didn't even pass bootcamp. And bootcamp is 
much easier then what most men like my father went through. So yes, you're 
a quitter and I have no respect for you or the people who quit when I went 
through. Little bitch can't hack it for a coupled weeks.﻿"
"89"	"Your just weak! Your Mommy was not there to hold you hand.﻿"
"90"	"Dont listen to this shit he's just blaming everyone else for his 
incompetence. He couldn't even graduate basic training cause the DIs were 
mean to him. Enjoy that dishonorable discharge man.﻿"
"91"	"Keep telling yourself whatever you have to to make yourself feel better for 
not being strong enough to make it....you're just a weak person who 
couldn't make the cut. I'm glad you were washed out, you're the type that 
would run and hide when the SHTF and let your brothers in arms die.﻿"
"92"	"LOL YOU ARE A SILLY BOY. Ever heard of ROE's? Of course not, you didn't 
finish bootcamp. You didn't deploy. This is just a compilation of moot 
points. You WERE never and you WILL never be a Marine. You didn't put your 
life on the line for anything......you barely got passed inprocessing.﻿"
"93"	"you are the dumbest fucker i have ever seen﻿"
"94"	"This was some of the dumbest shit I have ever heard man. This man is one of 
those 24/7 conspiracy theorist.﻿"
"95"	"I did 8 years in the military, I never shot anyone. I beat up more people 
in my highschool than I did in the military. Your views are totally wrong. 
Soldiers are dying over cellphone batteries? ha, you are deranged.﻿"
"96"	"I can't believe he talking bad about the military.your a joke period﻿"
"97"	"If you don't like being told what to do of thing you don't want to do then 
don't join﻿"
"98"	"my respect to you man your thinking!! your brainstorming. the government 
doesn't want you to think like that.all these people are stupid and only 
think one way﻿"
"99"	"your dumb If you think this is spot on"
"100"	"lol shut the fuck up bro. You were probably never in the military. You are 
hearing shit other people who were never in. The people who don't care 
about you is the government (politicians). When it comes to the military 
everyone cares for eachother. Its a brotherhood. You build great bonds, 
your chain of command cares for you and always trying to better their 
soldiers. dont give me that horseshit"
"101"	"He's just weak. If he couldn't take it, just say you couldn't take it. Your 
joining the military there is no racism, or at least very, very little. The 
military work for the UN, sure whatever makes you sleep at night."
"102"	"ur funny 😂"
"103"	"My dad in the Army called these guys assholes."

yourselves look dumb because you missed the whole point of the video. the 
joke is on you'll. blind bats smh."
"107"	"Yes but he is blaming it on others and others organizations. He just 
couldn't hack it. I'd love it if he just admitted that shit was too hard."

"119"	"I want to join the military, just for direction of life. Im open minded and 
just want the best for my life, im just confused and lost on choosing a 
branch and job. Any considerations?﻿"
"120"	"So you were a loser before then you were a loser in the chair force and you 
are still a loser﻿"
"121"	"LOL I was hoping to get some legit reasons what I may not enjoy about the 
air force because I am actually enlisting to serve this great country. I 
did watch all 9 minutes and something butttttt every reason you gave was 
bullshit and you just want to complain and gripe because it wasnt for you.﻿"
"122"	"4 and a half minutes in and I can see why you had no friends, no good job, 
and your parents wanted you out. What a cry baby. \"Woe is me\" should be the 
new title of this video.﻿"
"123"	"Sir call Hope for the Heart Ministries they can help you.. Seems like you 
were misplaced from you desired field.. Should have been assigned as an 
intelligence analyst but then again not as action oriented as an MP. It 
appears you have anger, rebellion and unforgiveness issues. I hope and pray 
you find peace and God in your life. God bless you! God loves you!! Matthew 
6:33, Proverbs 3:5&6, Jeremiah 29:11, 33:3, Josha 1:9. Take the Myer's 
Briggs test online for an accurate read of your personality, best career 
field etc. Go to college get your degree, then I dare you to go back in the 
military and become an officer, except forgive others and change your 
attitude for the better! You have humor, and intelligence just get rid of 
the anger and unforgiveness in your heart. Sounds like you need a father;s 
blessing in your life and maybe that's the hole in your heart that God can 
heal you from...﻿"
"124"	"so basically you hated the military because you hated your job? and didn't 
do enough thinking or research before going in...im sure if you were able 
to pick a job you actually liked then you would have been happy﻿"
"125"	"This guy is a huge fucking pussy. Assholes in the airforce?! Yah right 
what'd they do sternly speak to you and ask you not to do that again?﻿"
"126"	"I totally understand your experiences albeit you're personality and/or 
outlook is different than mine.﻿"
"127"	"I will never join the military b/c I don't want to end up like that dude in 
metallica's one, with no where to go and nothing to do﻿"
"128"	"So you just stated that you got out after 4 years and you are using the 
benefits that the military gives you to get your education. And not to 
mention the benefits of a fucking roof over your head and food to eat while 
you were in. You say you don't agree with the military or government but 
you're using all the benefits and money given to you. You're a hypocrite. 
And the United States is the best country on earth and if you weren't in to 
defend it. Then at least have the decency to not talk shit about it after 
you left, and got all your benefits.﻿"
"129"	"very good video showing another point of view of military life. Thank you 
and keep it coming.﻿"
"130"	"Haha your a pussy good enough that you are out but after all you were only 
in the chair force﻿"
"131"	"killing people for money is not a job .its murder called war. you grow up 
and do your own research people﻿"
"132"	"you are honest, in fact the army are corruptos﻿"
"133"	"This dude is completely dumbass you choose to do it over your mothers 
decision then blame it for bullshit next time make a decision like a man 
and become man and criticizing cops they are on edge so fucking pussy stick 
to delivering pizzas prick﻿"
"134"	"You are a pathetic little punk.﻿"
"135"	"I admire your honesty.﻿"
"136"	"lol your in the air force, get a straw and suck it up, imagine being in the 
marines.﻿"
"137"	"LOL at all you military worshipers coming to a VETERAN'S CHANNEL to try and 
diminish his LIVED EXPERIENCES because they don't line up with your

"139"	"since im from a small country in the Caribbean that literally dosent have 
an army i only dream of applying for the army or hope to land an Airforce 
job in the Uk yet you complain about little problems. Sure the army is not 
your thing but dont make it sound like a fucked up job cause its not.﻿"
"140"	"i am SO broke its not even funny. and how much do they pay when you're 
IN???﻿"
"141"	"Thank you! I was saying the same thing. It's mostly mercenary intentions 
why most enlist.﻿"
"142"	"hmm i wonder is any non sheep's actually joined the milotary﻿"
"143"	"Wait a minute... a furry who's not into sex? Now I've heard everything...﻿"
"144"	"well you are a fucking asshole. And I'VE learned that from experience after 
watching you complain for 9 minutes about bashing on the US military, and 
saying its their fault for your bad life in it. You signed the OPEN GENERAL 
contract, bud. Not only are you an asshole, but just plain stupid. Go to a 
bernie sanders rally, lib.﻿"
"145"	"Maybe no one wanted to help you succeed because of your bad attitude.﻿"
"146"	"Blaming everyone else for your problems. You signed the contract.﻿"
"147"	"Join the military for the money.. your going to have a bad time.﻿"
"148"	"6 weeks of air force basic training and you're complaining? join the

better? i'm totally confused as to why you didn't advance yourself.﻿"

the fuck did you join the air force you joined for all the wrong reasons﻿"
"156"	"true eveyone thinks anyone who joins is this patriotic person who loves the 
usa to tears﻿"
"157"	"You couldn't do anything for a job prior to the military? Nothing at all? 
Are you saying that it was impossible, or you weren't willing to try?﻿"

way it is, but it is great to hear it from the people participating.﻿"
"166"	"i mean has anyone actually read this stuff they write down? that as crazy

You learned the hard way...like everyone else does.
Not everyone finds a great job.
Maybe learn to drive a fork lift or sort mail........﻿"
"176"	"why r u such a negative nancy? People like you shouldn't be in the 
military.﻿"
"177"	"Shitting in your helmet then cooking in it? What the fuck do you think 
happens you bellend!﻿"
"178"	"why did you leave the military? because your a damn pussy that's why﻿"
"179"	"youre a total shitbag﻿"
"180"	"don't be mad because you picked the wrong field in the military. it's your 
fault. they just helped you with stability and know your ripping on them. 
asshole﻿"
"181"	"Im in shock, your scores (96 being the highest & 86 as your lowest score) 
should have propelled you to have a well decent position. Your mind and 
your totality was sadly wasted. For all its worth I hope you'll find the 
best career path.﻿"
"182"	"Then again you're a furry. That kinda ruined it﻿"

great life you commie﻿"
"188"	"what an asshole. lazy piece of shit, you couldnt provide to feed a cat. 
they need to chop off your balls so you cant infect the rest of the world 
with your stupidity﻿"
"189"	"why do you BELONG at a desk? you think because you have a high ASVAB score 
you are exempt from doing your job? had you took some initiative and showed 
them that you are ready and capable of more responsibility they would have 
given you more. you would have been able to do more then just check id's at 
a gate. but i can only correctly assume that you showed up to work with a 
shitty attitude and clocked out out with a shitty attitude because you 
thought you were too good for something that prevented you from being 
homeless and paid you a good salary. also seeing as you are utilizing the 
educational benefits after separating maybe just maybe it was worth it in 
the end.﻿"
"190"	"sorry dude i don't feel sorry for you at all. you fucked yourself in to 
your own little tiny hole﻿"
"191"	"you joined the wrong branch mother fucker. you ask anyone in the USMC if 
they did it for college benefits or money and i doubt you'll find many.﻿"
"192"	"why would you get out of the military? summed it up in your last sentence: 
wanted to get out since you got in. goes for everyone term member.﻿"
"193"	"A military recruited from a stupid population results in stupid 
soldiers..lots of soldiers are stupid, just like a civilian. cool video 
though, interesting.﻿"
"194"	"sounds like youre parents had a daughter instead of a man. fuckin lame.﻿"
"195"	"*cough* AIR FORCE *cough* no hate for anyone in but dude grow a pair. Tbh 
you prolly are in ISIS now. You complain about shit you did to yourself. 
The Air Force offers if not the most, second to most opportunities to the 
airmen that join out of all four branches of the military. Lmao you say 
horrible living conditions... *cough* AIR FORCE *cough*. You are just one 
of those people that complain about way to much. So much in the sense that 
life flys by your eyes so quick your parents are kicking you out of the 
house. And please god if you don't love this country it costs like 400$ for 
a one way flight to fucking Iceland, I'm sure they'd be glad to take you.﻿"
"196"	"i can see why his parent shared him﻿"

military anymore ...you are the sum of the earth you filthy fuck﻿"

"202"	"awesome video﻿"
"203"	"*This is why you don't go in open general. Ever. You fucking idiot.*﻿"
"204"	"Your recruiter screwed you over. I don't even know why he would want an 
airman in the air force if they hate their job. They should make sure 
airman are motivated by making sure they get some job they want.﻿"
"205"	"You sound like a liberal little bitch pussy.﻿"
"206"	"The ultimate thing you get out of the military if you dont do all 20 years, 
is the gi bill, the savings you may have accumulated, and the resume 
bragging rights.﻿"
"207"	"you're a fucking idiot﻿"
"208"	"What a fuckin pussy﻿"
"209"	"this guy pretty much summed up everything i feel about being in﻿"
"210"	"oh and training is non existence they expect u to just \"know\". Theres no 
logical thinking until shit goes bad. Lmao I always tell my friends sex is 
overrated.﻿"
"211"	"OMG! That was the realist shit Ive ever heard. I swear we lived the same 
life. Ppl are so fucking delusional about the military. I have 2 yrs left. 
I hate feeling like any stupid little thing will ruin ur life. Id rather 
get out before they kick me out for scratching my ass on a Tuesday. Fyi I 
share a desk with a furry lmao he's a Fox.﻿"
"212"	"wow not only is he bashing the military, but he was in the godamn airforce. 
I didn't appreciate the attitude towards law enforcement, but whatever this 
guy needs to just get over himself﻿"
"213"	"Listen if your joining the military for the money then maybe you should 
rethink it it's not for you.im leaving for basic training next month why am 
I joining I'm joining to serve and protect my country my family my friends 
to make sure they have a future a safe place to live fuck the money.all I 
see is a dumb ass crying cuzz he didn't get what he wanted and his parents 
didn't give him internet!!! It's not a job it's a lifestyle it's knowing 
that the man on your right on your left in front of you and behind you are 
all fighting for a purpose.so all the shit coming out of your mouth keep it 
there.﻿"
"214"	"Doubt you made a 96 on the ASVAB!﻿"
"215"	"what the fuck is wrong with you﻿"
"216"	"If you don't think the US military is used for nefarious purposes, but 
rather used to \"protect freedom\", you need to explain what the purpose of 
the School of the Americas was/is. (it has a different name now, but it 
still exists)﻿"
"217"	"Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to keep food in your mouth. It's a 
shame you couldn't remuster or find yourself somewhere else to be.﻿"
"218"	"Couldn't you of delayed enlistment until your job came up? I took the ASVAB 
and scored low. Didn't want to go in and be a cop. Ironically, I ended up 
working security yeeeears later lol.﻿"
"219"	"I've been in for 9years, i'm not going to re-enllist for 5-6 more fhuck 
that. i'm getting my post 9/11 and Getting the fuck out. Not into volunteer 
shit. not into those bullshit sports. not into deployments. don't want to 
be a fighter. i only live once i want to enjoy the rest of my young life. 
Sure the medical benefits and pay may be great/guaranteed but the work i 
will end up doing and putting myself through is not worth the $. Life is 
more important. I hate being put into impossible and unfavorable situations 
where i'm expected to do shit that takes way too much effort and make it 
happen right away fuck.﻿"
"220"	"Your just a big whinny bitch﻿"
"221"	"People in the military suck. Bottom of the barrel-people﻿"
"222"	"That's honestly the worse way to enlist is making it a sort of \"last ditch\" 
option.﻿"
"223"	"WOW who taught you how to be such a good victim Varmit?﻿"
"224"	"I hate when people think the military is filled with a bunch of guys going 
out and killing people, yes we do have combat jobs, yes our warriors in 
them kill bad people , but the rest of the military have normal jobs like 
cooks, electricians , plumbers, drivers, mechanics etc. God Bless the USA 
🇺🇸﻿"
"225"	"u have problems u study ur shit 1st😂 I was lucky enough to enlist when all 
the jobs where open nice job Budd u went open contract I'm not surprised 
where they put u because u went open contract 😂﻿"
"226"	"is this guy trolling or what﻿"
"227"	"ummm.....bro i got u on a tissue...﻿"
"228"	"You asshole, If you're failed in the Military do not recommend people to 
leave the Military. You nothing :)﻿"
"229"	"you sound like a whiner﻿"
"230"	"you should suicide﻿"
"231"	"The money XD what money you don't join for money﻿"
"232"	"You are mad because you were a shitbag airman. You blame your parents for 
no internet, heard of a fucking library? You didn't get along with anyone 
because you were a weirdo loser. sHITBAG, didn't even deploy bitch.﻿"
"233"	"History is a true treasury. And this is the oldest story in the world. If I 
were rich; would I do my dirty business myself? Nope, I would get some 
naieve guy/doll to do it in my place and give him petty cash in exchange 
and... a big lie to make up for the difference.﻿"
"234"	"This guy is probably a homophobic rapist now.﻿"
"235"	"There's no shame in admitting you were a coward, well done for speaking out 
about it.﻿"
"236"	"shoulda went army.﻿"
"237"	"Fucking pussy faggot﻿"
"238"	"I understand why your mommy kicked you out of her house﻿"
"239"	"Dude look the whole furry thing... thats not a common interest its not 
their fault for not understanding. i mean come on dude, it seems like you 
bitch to much. shouldve gone open mechanical you more then likley wouldve 
gotten air trans like me. and its a really wide field of people.﻿"
"240"	"\"WAR IS A RACKET\" by General Smedley Butler. He'll tell you about our

"241"	"Sorry for your experience in the Air Force﻿"
"242"	"Wow you're so edgy. I can tell from the moment you swore your superiority 
over your coworkers because they liked sports and you like furries.﻿"
"243"	"One fact : You didnt study in high school﻿"
"244"	"Cant wait to get out of the army﻿"
"245"	"Also, you people who are going on how 'Military is not for everyone' 

-_- Really, he just said it was either this or homeless... What other 
choice did he have? Second off, why did you even ask why he left the 
military...? He's not whinny, he's just saying it as it is. Yes it's nto 
for everyone, but when you have no choice then you take what life hands you.

So all you, shut up, i mean it too. You have no idea what you are talking 
about. And if half the people where there for 'honor the country' the 
military would be pretty small. I've seen good people get lied to by 
recruiters at my school. It's sad. So until you know how to say it without 
a 'praise the military' or 'unamerican' like comments, then don't say 
anything. 

Because until you've walked a day in this guys shoes, you have no idea what 
he's been through.

wont' respond to comments.... Why? It's not because i'm a coward, it's just 
people on the internet like to hid their face while spewing out their hate. 
I'm not trying to hate on anyone, but it's the truth...﻿"
"246"	"My video buffered right at 2:29

XD﻿"
"247"	"Take that ID tag off that's disrespectful to wear it like that and your 
ungreatfull scum﻿"
"248"	"so you left the military because youre a little pussy who cant handle some 
physical activities and are scared to fight for your country? seems legit﻿"
"249"	"The dark cloud rains, we're not surprised, but good luck anyway, I hope 
life picks up for you.-Sam﻿"
"250"	"A furry joining the military, only in the airforce will you see shit like 
that﻿"
"251"	"\"I went in open general\" the tradgy begins﻿"
"252"	"This whole video AND comments just made me roll my eyes, holy shit...﻿"
"253"	"Did this guy not realize that the military isn't a regular fucking job? I 
have no pity that he got the one single job he didn't want in the Air Force 
considering he had no real motivation before he joined the Air force. Him 
bitching about the resentment he has towards the military due to him not 
getting the job he wanted does no one any good. All this video does is 
anger people because of his bad attitude or make people who think like him 
happy to hear someone who was in the military say these things.﻿"
"254"	"Haha you quit because you were a chair force MP﻿"
"255"	"You're a fucking retard. Sounds like someone took the green weenie too 
hard. And to add to it, you were a fucking pog. Why are you complaining? 
Pussy.﻿"
"256"	"You are way too intelligent to do what you chose to do..﻿"
"257"	"Oh... It's your parents fault... Whatever you loser.﻿"
"258"	"i was with you until you mentioned \"Furry\" then i tuned out.﻿"
"259"	"also i feel you are lying if you averaged in the 90s on tests you were 
given. Also you could have asked the recruiter what jobs are avalible and 
find a better field then what you picked. I feel picking general you set 
yourself up. I can tell you that security is probably one of the most hated 
jobs and most people stay away from that so it is the job that is most 
needed to be filled.﻿"
"260"	"wait are you getting money for education from the military? What kind of 
job do you expect in the real world? I really dont get it couldnt you just 
leave during boot camp? If you have no money or job now where the fuck are 
you living?﻿"
"261"	"wut a pussy.﻿"
"262"	"bro the air force was hard for you?? really??? the most laid back branch 
and your whining and bitching. Jesus you might as well work at McDonald's 
and cry that you demand 15$ an hour fuckin pussy﻿"
"263"	"can you bitch anymore jesus  your a sad excuse for a person!﻿"
"264"	"Nice parents.....﻿"
"265"	"Only fools will join army. You're technically \"collateral damage\" and a 
politician's puppet/pawn. What glory? When you die in war, nobody will 
remember your name 10 years down the road unless you're some high-ranking 
general. What honour? In ancient times, soldiers and slaves belong to the 
same social class. And when you get out from army, your experiences in army 
are useless and no companies will hire you. Google for real life stories 
of army veterans who are jobless and homeless! Get real. If a war is coming 
to your country, escape to another country, don't be a fool to fight as a 
politician's pawn!﻿"
"266"	"Use the library for internet..................................﻿"
"267"	"I can only hint at the real reason I joined the army.  Call me a suicide 
bomber, but you won't get it out of me in simple terms. I shall not 
confess. Then I went to AIT and things perked up, and I didn't hate being 
alive anymore.  Nothing like food and sleep.  The psychotronic people try 
to make me go back to that life, not the military, but to the conditions 
prior.  If you think the army is bad, wait until you get a second mommy on 
your back claiming to be a fallen angel.﻿"
"268"	"The military gave you a home and a job when you really needed one. Grow up.﻿"
"269"	"Love this. Thanks for telling it like it really is.﻿"
"270"	"So basically this whole video was you showing how much of a whinny bitch 
you are? Thanks for the clarification. USMC - Terminal Lance﻿"
"271"	"At first I was like \"Ok, whatever\" then you became a raving lunatic, and 
you mentioned furries. The latter may be personal disinterest, but you sir, 
are clearly unfit to serve.﻿"
"272"	"The marine recruiter I had was a dick he fucked over me and my friend from 
going all bc we did not kiss his ass and buy shit for him like gas . Don't 
get me wrong i still want to join the marines but can't with that marine 
recruiter still being there .﻿"
"273"	"You're a sad excuse for a veteran. And a narcissistic dipshit. Oh, and a 
pansy﻿"
"274"	"Surprised you made it for an entire tour.﻿"
"275"	"I hear you and I totally get why you are mad. But you seem. . 
.EXCEPTIONALLY mad. Like, maybe you should get some help mad. I get why you 
are pissed at the military but don't let anger or this idea of superiority 
over people make it hard for you to find happiness.﻿"
"276"	"I'm so sorry you have to put up with all these worthless idiots here in the 
comments section. Everything you say is absolutely true. Props for you for 
standing up for yourself and the truth! :)﻿"

"278"	"Handsome and Honest! Thank YOu!﻿"
"279"	"I met this guy while i was in, 100% sure (IM GLAD He DOESNT BELONG 
THERE)....I think everybody takes alot of shit in the military, and that is 
what the military is for, TO MAKE A REAL MAN FROM YOU, so you can go to war 
and defend our beautifull freedom, I think I had it worst than this guy, 
and to this day I AM VERY PROUD THAT I WAS GIVEN THE OPORTUNITY TO SERVE 
THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE BRAVE. 

I know live far from the BEAUTIFULL UNITED STATES AND I KEEP A FLAG BY MY 
HOUSE AS A SIMBOL THAT A REAL AMERICAN LIVES PROUDLY, CAUSE HE DEFENDED 
FREEDOM.....SOMEHOW I GUESS

PRETTY SOON WILL BE VETERANS DAY... A DAY YOU EARNED AND YOU DO NOT DESERVE 
FOR TALKING THAT WAY....﻿"
"280"	"By the way, I bet he got a Dishonorable Discharge, but he says he didn't. 
So how easy was that Air Force life? You are a bitch!﻿"
"281"	"This guy is a full piece of shit!﻿"
"282"	"So basically out of ALL the options at your disposal your dumb ass chose 
the one you hated the most. ANd now you blame your misery on the military. 
Moron. You could of done SO MANY other things besides join the military. 
You are a whiny, bitch ass trick. Its obvious you attempted to make this 
video humorous probably thinking in some pipe dream way that someone would 
see it and offer you a TV deal. Fail. lol And thank fuckin god you're not 
in the U.S. military.﻿"
"283"	"I give this man kudos. He stands there a is brutally honest about his 
opinion about the military. Not many people have the balls to do that. I 
don't blame them though cause if you tell anyone you don't like or don't 
support the military these days you might as well have just shot yourself 
in the face.﻿"
"284"	"Bravo!﻿"
"285"	"Deport his ass and kick him out of the country.﻿"
"286"	"You a weird dude, California I'm guessing﻿"
"287"	"If you were so smart, \"getting an average of 92\" why wouldn't you have 
joined a branch of service in which you could choose your mos? You could 
have joined the guard and go to school and have it all covered. For being 
smarter than 90% of the population you are a fucking idiot.﻿"
"288"	"You weren't in the military. Maybe Jrotc, but not the real Air Force. 
Whenever I see you, I smell bacon. You fucking pig.﻿"
"289"	"Oh you are cool hahaha I would enjoy talking with you :D﻿"
"290"	"No wonder he hates his life. He went SecFo.﻿"
"291"	"Sounds about right﻿"
"292"	"We need a reformation of America's military﻿"
"293"	"People that join thinking their defending freedom 1,000's of miles away 
from country are fucking retarded, especially when your fighting a \"war on 
terror\". Dumb people and poor people fight the war for the rich.﻿"
"294"	"Holy fuck you are stupid.﻿"
"295"	"God you know what we love in the military? The guy who thinks he's too 
smart for his job and doesn't contribute. I understand the military isn't 
for everyone but you sound like a real shit bag who brought down every 
one's morale. You got in to all that trouble and still seem to deflect 
blame for all your shortcomings. People don't appreciate that in any 
environment civilian or otherwise. Good riddance.﻿"
"296"	"I served 7 years in the army at 3 different duty stations. I have had some 
good times and bad and I must say I agree overall with this video. However, 
I will say I would encourage young men and women to join and get the 
benefits. The people are not always the best. lots of dog eat dog 
mentality. You have to have a killer instinct and if you don't you may end 
up making a video like this one. I had the same problem to a point but I 
dealt with a lot racism and people who were spiteful over things in their 
past. lf you can deal with those guys then you are fine. If you can't watch 
your 6 because everyone in the army has an agenda.﻿"
"297"	"This guy is a tool. If you join the military for the wrong reasons, of 
course you're going to hate it! If I become an investment banker but hate 
everything to do with finance... then I'm probably going to hate investment 
banking. There's a reason the guy has no job.﻿"
"298"	"You are a fucking idiot. So one sided it's unreal.﻿"
"299"	"Stupid people born from stupid decisions. You're weak, and you realized 
that, but you still tried to compete anyways. You paid the price as a 
result.

At least you didn't try to become a marine.﻿"

well Soo ...﻿"

not, the people around you would have killed you. Grow some balls little

"308"	"I hear people say all the time that I need to respect the military and that 
they are fighting for my rights. I mean, they are right! I mean, I sure am 
glad that the military is out defending the U.S. from foreigners invading 
our country and holding our country as a hostage until they completely 
drain our natural resources. Oh wait...﻿"

air force... have that same question with 100 Marines and see how many 
raise their hands.. don't join the air force if you don't have an education

benefits and them only, you're joining for the wrong reason. If you want to 
do shit you like and enjoy DO SOMETHING YOU WANT. you are literally Grade A 
ignorant...﻿"

I wholeheartedly agree. Military as a whole is meant to kill or deter and 
even the cooks are there to support that mission. But as far as personnel 
is concerned its only a small percentage of the military that has the 
actual job of doing that. The rest are support roles. In the AF I think 
pilots are the only ones that specific role. There is another, I think 
their primary job is rescue but are highly combat trained due to where they 
have to potentially perform rescues. The entire time I was in I was never 
issued an M16 but did have maintain qualification. Even deployed for war 
they didn't hand us a M16 but they did ship our guns onsite in case they 
were needed. But most of the AF is nowhere near the combat area since we 
have planes that fly to the combat area. If we need our M16 then most 
likely they have already tried to evac us before the guns are needed."

Actually he was pretty whinny. He got himself into it by going in Open 
General. Even when I went in I knew that was a mistake so I didn't do it. I 
think that everyone I ever met while in that went in Open General wasn't 
exactly bright no matter what they thought of themselves. You are right 
about the \"honor the country\" part but when I joined, people joined by 
choice instead of circumstance although I'm sure there were some that went 
in because of that. Pretty much all of them that I knew went in for the job 
and school but most of those did have the \"honor the country\" part to them 
as well. I don't think my entire time in did I meet anyone that only went 
in because of \"honor the country\". But I was in the AF so that type of 
person was most likely Army or Marines. As far as lies from recruiters that 
is pretty much untrue. Most of the time people say a recruiter lied its 
because they didn't ask the question and the recruiter didn't volunteer it 
but rarely is it a out and out lie. I remember 1 time with the Finance 
office that I had a situation that I was told that if I asked a direct 
question about a specific item then they could tell me how to \"loop hole\" 
something but they couldn't tell me without me asking. I do know that if 
anyone goes in \"to see the world\" then they are pretty stupid. That has 
been a running joke for decades in the movies so no one has any excuse to 
think that and then be pissed off when they don't. I spent 10 years in and 
was never stationed out of the US even though I put it for overseas. I did 
however get to go to Ireland, Italy, Spain, France, Saudi, Kuwait and

Quran (2:191-193) - \"And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them 
out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or 
unrest] is worse than killing...
but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight 
them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others 
along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let 
there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and 
wrong-doers, etc.)\" (Translation is from the Noble Quran) The verse prior 
to this (190) refers to \"fighting for the cause of Allah those who fight 
you\" leading some to believe that the entire passage refers to a defensive 
war in which Muslims are defending their homes and families. The historical 
context of this passage is not defensive warfare, however, since Muhammad 
and his Muslims had just relocated to Medina and were not under attack by 
their Meccan adversaries. In fact, the verses urge offensive warfare, in 
that Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city (which they later 
did). Verse 190 thus means to fight those who offer resistance to Allah's 
rule (ie. Muslim conquest). The use of the word \"persecution\" by some 
Muslim translators is disingenuous (the actual Arabic words for persecution 
- \"idtihad\" - and oppression - a variation of \"z-l-m\" - do not appear in 
the verse). The word used instead, \"fitna\", can mean disbelief, or the 
disorder that results from unbelief or temptation. This is certainly what 
is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned 
\"until religion is for Allah\" - ie. unbelievers desist in their unbelief.

Quran (2:244) - \"Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah 
Heareth and knoweth all things.\"

Quran (2:216) - \"Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it 
is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love 
a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.\" Not only 
does this verse establish that violence can be virtuous, but it also 
contradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in self-defense, since 
the audience was obviously not under attack at the time. From the Hadith, 
we know that this verse was narrated at a time that Muhammad was actually 
trying to motivate his people into raiding merchant caravans for loot.

Quran (3:56) - \"As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with 
terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have 
anyone to help.\"

Quran (3:151) - \"Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the 
Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had 
sent no authority\". This speaks directly of polytheists, yet it also 
includes Christians, since they believe in the Trinity (ie. what Muhammad 
incorrectly believed to be 'joining companions to Allah').

Quran (4:74) - \"Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of 
this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain 
or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.\" The martyrs of 
Islam are unlike the early Christians, who were led meekly to the 
slaughter. These Muslims are killed in battle as they attempt to inflict 
death and destruction for the cause of Allah. This is the theological basis 
for today's suicide bombers.

Quran (4:76) - \"Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…\"

Quran (4:89) - \"They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and 
thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their 
ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if 
they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and 
(in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.\"

Quran (4:95) - \"Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), 
except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and 
those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and 
their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight 
with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home).Unto each, 
Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who 
strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward \" 
This passage criticizes \"peaceful\" Muslims who do not join in the violence, 
letting them know that they are less worthy in Allah's eyes. It also 
demolishes the modern myth that \"Jihad\" doesn't mean holy war in the Quran, 
but rather a spiritual struggle. Not only is this Arabic word (mujahiduna) 
used in this passage, but it is clearly not referring to anything 
spiritual, since the physically disabled are given exemption. (The Hadith 
reveals the context of the passage to be in response to a blind man's 
protest that he is unable to engage in Jihad, which would not make sense if 
it meant an internal struggle).

Quran (4:104) - \"And be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy; if you 
suffer pain, then surely they (too) suffer pain as you suffer pain...\" Is 
pursuing an injured and retreating enemy really an act of self-defense?

Quran (5:33) - \"The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His 
messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they 
should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut 
off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a 
disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a 
grievous chastisement\"

Quran (8:12) - \"I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. 
Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them\" No 
reasonable person would interpret this to mean a spiritual struggle.

Quran (8:15) - \"O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in 
battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back 
to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he 
truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a 
hapless journey's end.\"

Quran (8:39) - \"And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, 
unbelief) and religion is all for Allah\" Some translations interpret 
\"fitna\" as \"persecution\", but the traditional understanding of this word is 
not supported by the historical context (See notes for 2:193). The Meccans 
were simply refusing Muhammad access to their city during Haj. Other 
Muslims were allowed to travel there - just not as an armed group, since 
Muhammad had declared war on Mecca prior to his eviction. The Meccans were 
also acting in defense of their religion, since it was Muhammad's intention 
to destroy their idols and establish Islam by force (which he later did). 
Hence the critical part of this verse is to fight until \"religion is only 
for Allah\", meaning that the true justification of violence was the 
unbelief of the opposition. According to the Sira (Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 324) 
Muhammad further explains that \"Allah must have no rivals.\"

Quran (8:57) - \"If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to 
strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.\"

Quran (8:67) - \"It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of 
war until he had made a great slaughter in the land...\"

Quran (8:59-60) - \"And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can 
outstrip (Allah's Purpose). Lo! they cannot escape. Make ready for them all 
thou canst of (armed) force and of horses tethered, that thereby ye may 
dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy.\"

Quran (8:65) - \"O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight...\"

Quran (9:5) - \"So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the 
idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them 
and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up 
prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.\" According to 
this verse, the best way of staying safe from Muslim violence is to convert 
to Islam (prayer (salat) and the poor tax (zakat) are among the religion's 
Five Pillars). This popular claim that the Quran only inspires violence 
within the context of self-defense is seriously challenged by this passage 
as well, since the Muslims to whom it was written were obviously not under 
attack. Had they been, then there would have been no waiting period 
(earlier verses make it a duty for Muslims to fight in self-defense, even 
during the sacred months). The historical context is Mecca after the 
idolaters were subjugated by Muhammad and posed no threat. Once the Muslims 
had power, they violently evicted those unbelievers who would not convert.

Quran (9:14) - \"Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your 
hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts 
of a believing people.\" Humiliating and hurting non-believers not only has 
the blessing of Allah, but it is ordered as a means of carrying out his 
punishment and even \"healing\" the hearts of Muslims.

Quran (9:20) - \"Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven 
with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth 
in Allah's sight. These are they who are triumphant.\" The Arabic word 
interpreted as \"striving\" in this verse is the same root as \"Jihad\". The 
context is obviously holy war.

Quran (9:29) - \"Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor 
hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, 
nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of 
the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel 
themselves subdued.\" \"People of the Book\" refers to Christians and Jews. 
According to this verse, they are to be violently subjugated, with the sole 
justification being their religious status. Verse 9:33 tells Muslims that 
Allah has charted them to make Islam \"superior over all religions.\" This 
chapter was one of the final \"revelations\" from Allah and it set in motion 
the tenacious military expansion, in which Muhammad's companions managed to 
conquer two-thirds of the Christian world in the next 100 years. Islam is 
intended to dominate all other people and faiths.


Quran (9:30) - \"And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; and the 
Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of 
their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may 
Allah destroy them; how they are turned away!\"

Quran (9:38-39) - \"O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, 
when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to 
the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little 
is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go 
forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your 
place.\" This is a warning to those who refuse to fight, that they will be 
punished with Hell.

Quran (9:41) - \"Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your 
wealth and your lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but 
knew.\" See also the verse that follows (9:42) - \"If there had been 
immediate gain (in sight), and the journey easy, they would (all) without 
doubt have followed thee, but the distance was long, (and weighed) on them\" 
This contradicts the myth that Muslims are to fight only in self-defense, 
since the wording implies that battle will be waged a long distance from 
home (in another country and on Christian soil, in this case, according to 
the historians).


Quran (9:73) - \"O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the 
hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is 
the destination.\" Dehumanizing those who reject Islam, by reminding Muslims 
that unbelievers are merely firewood for Hell, makes it easier to justify 
slaughter. It also explains why today's devout Muslims have little regard 
for those outside the faith.

Quran (9:88) - \"But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive 
and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good 
things: and it is they who will prosper.\"


Quran (9:111) - \"Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and 
their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight 
in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, 
through the Law, the Gospel, and the Quran: and who is more faithful to his 
covenant than Allah? then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: 
that is the achievement supreme.\" How does the Quran define a true believer?

Quran (9:123) - \"O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are 
near to you and let them find in you hardness.\"

Quran (17:16) - \"And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our 
commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress 
therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter 
destruction.\" Note that the crime is moral transgression, and the 
punishment is \"utter destruction.\" (Before ordering the 9/11 attacks, Osama 
bin Laden first issued Americans an invitation to Islam).

Quran (18:65-81) - This parable lays the theological groundwork for honor 
killings, in which a family member is murdered because they brought shame 
to the family, either through apostasy or perceived moral indiscretion. The 
story (which is not found in any Jewish or Christian source) tells of Moses 
encountering a man with \"special knowledge\" who does things which don't 
seem to make sense on the surface, but are then justified according to 
later explanation. One such action is to murder a youth for no apparent 
reason (74). However, the wise man later explains that it was feared that 
the boy would \"grieve\" his parents by \"disobedience and ingratitude.\" He 
was killed so that Allah could provide them a 'better' son. [Note: This 
parable along with verse 58:22 is a major reason that honor killing is 
sanctioned by Sharia. Reliance of the Traveler (Umdat al-Saliq) says that 
punishment for murder is not applicable when a parent or grandparent kills 
their offspring (o.1.12).]

Quran (21:44) - \"We gave the good things of this life to these men and 
their fathers until the period grew long for them; See they not that We 
gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? Is 
it then they who will win?\"

Quran (25:52) - \"Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive 
against them with the utmost strenuousness...\" \"Strive against\" is Jihad - 
obviously not in the personal context. It's also significant to point out 
that this is a Meccan verse.

Quran (33:60-62) - \"If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a 
disease, and the alarmists in the city do not cease, We verily shall urge 
thee on against them, then they will be your neighbors in it but a little 
while. Accursed, they will be seized wherever found and slain with a 
(fierce) slaughter.\" This passage sanctions the slaughter (rendered 
\"merciless\" and \"horrible murder\" in other translations) against three 
groups: Hypocrites (Muslims who refuse to \"fight in the way of Allah\" (3:167) 
and hence don't act as Muslims should), those with \"diseased hearts\" (which 
include Jews and Christians 5:51-52), and \"alarmists\" or \"agitators who 
include those who merely speak out against Islam, according to Muhammad's 
biographers. It is worth noting that the victims are to be sought out by 
Muslims, which is what today's terrorists do. If this passage is meant 
merely to apply to the city of Medina, then it is unclear why it is 
included in Allah's eternal word to Muslim generations.

Quran (47:3-4) - \"Those who disbelieve follow falsehood, while those who 
believe follow the truth from their Lord... So, when you meet (in fight 
Jihad in Allah's Cause), those who disbelieve smite at their necks till 
when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on 
them, i.e. take them as captives)... If it had been Allah's Will, He 
Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you 
fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those who are killed in 
the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.\" Those who reject 
Allah are to be killed in Jihad. The wounded are to be held captive for 
ransom. The only reason Allah doesn't do the dirty work himself is to to 
test the faithfulness of Muslims. Those who kill pass the test.

Quran (47:35) - \"Be not weary and faint-hearted, crying for peace, when ye 
should be uppermost (Shakir: \"have the upper hand\") for Allah is with you,\"

Quran (48:17) - \"There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for 
the lame, nor is there blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war). 
And whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger, He will make him enter Gardens 
underneath which rivers flow; and whoso turneth back, him will He punish 
with a painful doom.\" Contemporary apologists sometimes claim that Jihad 
means 'spiritual struggle.' Is so, then why are the blind, lame and sick 
exempted? This verse also says that those who do not fight will suffer 
torment in hell.

Quran (48:29) - \"Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are 
hard (ruthless) against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves\" 
Islam is not about treating everyone equally. This verse tells Muslims that 
there are two very distinct standards that are applied based on religious 
status. Also the word used for 'hard' or 'ruthless' in this verse shares 
the same root as the word translated as 'painful' or severe' to describe 
Hell in over 25 other verses including 65:10, 40:46 and 50:26..

Quran (61:4) - \"Surely Allah loves those who fight in His cause\" Religion 
of Peace, indeed!  The verse explicitly refers to \"rows\" or \"battle array,\" 
meaning that it is speaking of physical conflict. This is followed by 
(61:9), which defines the \"cause\": \"He it is who has sent His Messenger 
(Mohammed) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islam) to make it 
victorious over all religions even though the infidels may resist.\" (See 
next verse, below). Infidels who resist Islamic rule are to be fought.

Quran (61:10-12) - \"O You who believe! Shall I guide you to a commerce that 
will save you from a painful torment. That you believe in Allah and His 
Messenger (Muhammad), and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of 
Allah with your wealth and your lives, that will be better for you, if you 
but know! (If you do so) He will forgive you your sins, and admit you into 
Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwelling in Gardens of'Adn- 
Eternity ['Adn(Edn) Paradise], that is indeed the great success.\" This 
verse refers to physical battle in order to make Islam victorious over 
other religions (see verse 9). It uses the Arabic root for the word Jihad.

Quran (66:9) - \"O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the 
hypocrites, and be stern with them. Hell will be their home, a hapless 
journey's end.\" The root word of \"Jihad\" is used again here. The context is 
clearly holy war, and the scope of violence is broadened to include 
\"hypocrites\" - those who call themselves Muslims but do not act as such.

Hadith and Sira
Sahih Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, \"The Hour will not be 
established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew 
will be hiding will say. \"O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so 
kill him.\"

Sahih Bukhari (52:256) - The Prophet... was asked whether it was 
permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of 
exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, \"They 
(i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans).\" In this command, 
Muhammad establishes that it is permissible to kill non-combatants in the 
process of killing a perceived enemy. This provides justification for the 
many Islamic terror bombings.

Sahih Bukhari (52:65) - The Prophet said, 'He who fights that Allah's Word 
(Islam) should be superior, fights in Allah's Cause. Muhammad's words are 
the basis for offensive Jihad - spreading Islam by force. This is how it 
was understood by his companions, and by the terrorists of today. (See also 
Sahih Bukhari 3:125)

Sahih Bukhari (52:220) - Allah's Apostle said... 'I have been made 
victorious with terror'

Abu Dawud (14:2526) - The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Three things 
are the roots of faith: to refrain from (killing) a person who utters, 
\"There is no god but Allah\" and not to declare him unbeliever whatever sin 
he commits, and not to excommunicate him from Islam for his any action; and 
jihad will be performed continuously since the day Allah sent me as a 
prophet until the day the last member of my community will fight with the 
Dajjal (Antichrist)

Abu Dawud (14:2527) - The Prophet said: Striving in the path of Allah 
(jihad) is incumbent on you along with every ruler, whether he is pious or 
impious

Muslim (1:33) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight 
against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that 
Muhammad is the messenger of Allah

Bukhari (8:387) - Allah's Apostle said, \"I have been ordered to fight the 
people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. And 
if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we 
slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will 
not interfere with them except legally.\"

Muslim (1:30) - \"The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to 
fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god 
but Allah.\"

Bukhari (52:73) - \"Allah's Apostle said, 'Know that Paradise is under the 
shades of swords'.\"

Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] \"I decided to order a man to lead the 
prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their 
houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.\"

Muslim (1:149) - \"Abu Dharr reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, which of 
the deeds is the best? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and 
Jihad in His cause...\"

Muslim (20:4645) - \"...He (the Messenger of Allah) did that and said: There 
is another act which elevates the position of a man in Paradise to a grade 
one hundred (higher), and the elevation between one grade and the other is 
equal to the height of the heaven from the earth. He (Abu Sa'id) said: What 
is that act? He replied: Jihad in the way of Allah! Jihad in the way of 
Allah!\"

Muslim (20:4696) - \"the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: 
'One who died but did not fight in the way of Allah nor did he express any 
desire (or determination) for Jihad died the death of a hypocrite.'\"

Muslim (19:4321-4323) - Three separate hadith in which Muhammad shrugs over 
the news that innocent children were killed in a raid by his men against 
unbelievers. His response: \"They are of them (meaning the enemy).\"

Muslim (19:4294) - \"When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 
appointed anyone as leader of an army or detachment he would especially 
exhort him... He would say: Fight in the name of Allah and in the way of 
Allah. Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When 
you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of 
action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and 
withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; 
if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting 
against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. 
If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they 
refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.\"

Muslim (31:5917) - \"Ali went a bit and then halted and did not look about 
and then said in a loud voice: 'Allah's Messenger, on what issue should I 
fight with the people?' Thereupon he (the Prophet) said: 'Fight with them 
until they bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and 
Muhammad is his Messenger'.\" The pretext for attacking the peaceful farming 
community of Khaibar was not obvious to the Muslims. Muhammad's son-in-law 
Ali asked the prophet of Islam to clarify the reason for their mission to 
kill, loot and enslave. Muhammad's reply was straightforward. The people 
should be fought because they are not Muslim.

Muslim (31:5918) - \"I will fight them until they are like us.\" Ali's reply 
to Muhammad, after receiving clarification that the pretext for attack 
Khaibar was to convert the people (see above verse).

Bukhari 1:35 \"The person who participates in (Holy Battles) in Allah’s 
cause and nothing compels him do so except belief in Allah and His Apostle, 
will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, or booty ( if he 
survives) or will be admitted to Paradise ( if he is killed).\"

Tabari 7:97 The morning after the murder of Ashraf, the Prophet declared, 
\"Kill any Jew who falls under your power.\" Ashraf was a poet, killed by 
Muhammad's men because he insulted Islam. Here, Muhammad widens the scope 
of his orders to kill. An innocent Jewish businessman was then slain by his 
Muslim partner, merely for being non-Muslim.

Tabari 9:69 \"Killing Unbelievers is a small matter to us\" The words of 
Muhammad, prophet of Islam.

Tabari 17:187 \"'By God, our religion (din) from which we have departed is 
better and more correct than that which these people follow. Their religion 
does not stop them from shedding blood, terrifying the roads, and seizing 
properties.' And they returned to their former religion.\" The words of a 
group of Christians who had converted to Islam, but realized their error 
after being shocked by the violence and looting committed in the name of 
Allah. The price of their decision to return to a religion of peace was 
that the men were beheaded and the woman and children enslaved by the 
caliph Ali.

Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 484: - “Allah said, ‘A prophet must slaughter before 
collecting captives. A slaughtered enemy is driven from the land. Muhammad, 
you craved the desires of this world, its goods and the ransom captives 
would bring. But Allah desires killing them to manifest the religion.’”

Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 990:- Lest anyone think that cutting off someone's head 
while screaming 'Allah Akbar!' is a modern creation, here is an account of 
that very practice under Muhammad, who seems to approve.

Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 992: - \"Fight everyone in the way of Allah and kill those 
who disbelieve in Allah.\" Muhammad's instructions to his men prior to a 
military raid.

Saifur Rahman, The Sealed Nectar p.227-228 - \"Embrace Islam... If you two 
accept Islam, you will remain in command of your country; but if your 
refuse my Call, you’ve got to remember that all of your possessions are 
perishable. My horsemen will appropriate your land, and my Prophethood will 
assume preponderance over your kingship.\" One of several letters from 
Muhammad to rulers of other countries. The significance is that the 
recipients were not making war or threatening Muslims. Their subsequent 
defeat and subjugation by Muhammad's armies was justified merely on the 
basis of their unbelief."
