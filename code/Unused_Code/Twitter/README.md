Here lies code to pull tweets and users from twitter, perform sentiment
analysis, and text mine the tweets you find.  

Here you'll find all the code I wrote to grab twitter data and perform
analysis, and there should be three files numbered at the top,
1_Scraping_Twitter.R
2_Sentiment_Analysis_Twitter.R
3_Plotting_Twitter.R

which contain the basic structure of my work without all the trial and error.
The goal for those is to allow one to scrape without much trouble just by
asking for what you want
