# NOTE: there is no Data folder because all data was collected from YouTube rather than provided through a different source

### There are 2 Folders: Code and Output

#### The Code folder contains two Rscripts: Analysis and ScrapData
###### The Analysis script contains all code used to create the stacked bar graph included on the social media poster
########## Note the "Why I Quit" word cloud and correlations were created using Gizem's code

###### The ScrapData script contains all the code used to scrape data using the YouTube API

#### The Output folder contains three files: alltexts, leave, and quitting
###### alltexts is a csvfile that contains the output from all videos scraped from YouTube
###### leave is a text file of the ORIGINAL why i quit comments that I sent to Gizem via email BEFORE religious related comments were removed from the video's webpage and this file is used to create the word cloud on the poster
###### quitting is a csv file os the why i quit comments AFTER the religious related comments were removed from the video's webpage
